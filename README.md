#DSA-Day-3<br/>
ðŸš€Day 3/100 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode: DSA in C++ ðŸš€<br/>

Today, <br/>
I learnt the very basics of Data Structures and Algorithms, different types of data structures and time and space complexity. I also solved a couple of questions on time and space complexity and learned about asymptotic notations and the types. 
These are some very basic things important for optimum and efficient coding. Excited for the journey ahead to lay down a strong foundation in DSA!
